It is used as the basis for explaining the basics of the language facilities, it’s tool chain and execution.

For as long as there is a console, “hello world” will be there

Originally Answered: What are some examples of high-quality code?
Anything that does what it’s supposed to do, efficiently, quickly and totally.

Good example: GIMP image software. Slow to load because it’s massive, but once it does, it will do anything and everything image related, very quickly and correctly.

Bad example: HP Printer software. Slow to load, slow to activate, slow to print, slow to die the hideous and gruesome death that it rightfully deserves. Use something else, anything else; hand copying with pen and paper is faster.
