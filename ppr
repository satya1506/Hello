
OQ: What are some examples of great code?

This:

10 PRINT “Hello World!” 
The humble “hello world” program. It has been used as the introductory program in every language.
It tells you whether the language is procedural:

#include <stdio.h> 
 
int main() { 
	printf("Hello World!"); 
	return 0; 
} 
or object oriented:

using System;  
 
namespace MyFirstProgram {  
	public class Greeter {  
		static void Main() {  
			Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
		} 
	} 
} 
It is used as the basis for explaining the basics of the language facilities, it’s tool chain and execution.

For as long as there is a console, “hello world” will be there

Anything that does what it’s supposed to do, efficiently, quickly and totally.

Good example: GIMP image software. Slow to load because it’s massive, but once it does, it will do anything and everything image related, very quickly and correctly.

Bad example: HP Printer software. Slow to load, slow to activate, slow to print, slow to die the hideous and gruesome death that it rightfully deserves. Use something else, anything else; hand copying with pen and paper is faster.
